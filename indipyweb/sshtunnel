SSH TUNNEL

Assuming drivers and indipyserver are running on a remote device (raspberry5 in this example)

However indipyserver on raspberry5 is set to listen on localhost:7624 only, so this port is not exposed.

On my own PC, which has ssh public key access to raspberry5, I could simply create a session and run indipyterm on the raspberry5.

However in this example I want to run indipyterm, or indipyweb locally on my PC.

So on my PC I create a tunnel, using

ssh -NL 7624:localhost:7624 bernard@raspberry5&

This creates an SSH tunnel, and the final ampersand runs it in the background. A process such as "[1] 4208" will be shown.

Then run indipyterm, or indipyweb which normally would communicate to my own localhost:7624. But in this case the tunnel forwards my own port 7624 to the raspberry5's localhost:7624, and indipyterm or indipyweb now connect to the indi service.

This allows a web server to run locally, giving local web access to a remote device via an encrypted ssh session.

To kill the tunnel, type:

kill %1

Where the 1 comes from the "[1] 4208".
