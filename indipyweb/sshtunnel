Assuming drivers and indipyserver are running on a remote device (raspberry5 in this example)

However indipyserver is set to listen on localhost:7624 only, so this port is not exposed.


On my own PC, which has full ssh public key access to raspberry5, I could simply create a session and run indipyterm on the raspberry5.

However in this example I want to run indipyterm, or indipyweb locally on my PC.

So on my PC I create a tunnel, using

ssh -L 7624:localhost:7624 bernard@raspberry5

This opens an SSH session, which I park to one side. Then in another terminal I can run indipyterm, or indipyweb which communicate to my own localhost:7624.


But in this case the above command forwards my own port 7624 to the raspberry5's localhost:7624, and indipyterm/indipyweb now connect to the indi service.

This allows a web server to run locally, giving local web access to a remote device via an encrypted ssh session.
