"""
sendblob.py should be running on a remote device,
('raspberrypi' in this example), which needs its ipyserver host
to be set at 0.0.0.0 so that a connection can be made to it.
This program makes a connection to the remote, and
snoops on the BLOBs it is sending, and saves its own
copies.  It also serves the INDI port for a local client to
connect and sends an Alert light if it is not getting BLOBs.
A client connected here will see both the light and the
blob instrument.
