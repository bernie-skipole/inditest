   This test.py has a number of devices and drivers intended to test a connected client.

   A "switches" device consisting of several SwitchVectors
   illustrating switch rules OneOfMany AtMostOne AnyOfMany and ReadOnly
   The ReadOnly switches are continuously changing.

   A "lights" device with one vector of binary counting lights and
   one vector which snoops on the AnyOfMany vector of the switches device
   and displays lights corresponding to the switches

   A "numbers" device has two number vectors, a read only time
   and a read-write value

   A "textdevice" with two vectors, one ro which regularly changes and one rw

   A "blobmaker" device has two vectors one receiving and one sending BLOBs"""
